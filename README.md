#  ‧͙⁺˚*･༓☾ Hai~!!　☽༓･*˚⁺‧͙

I’m **bloom**
I’m a writer, creative technologist, and dreamer who blends imagination, music, and code to build meaningful things.

## About Me
I love weaving stories and building projects that feel human, empathetic, and a little magical.  
Music is my constant fuel: from dreamy indie & lo-fi to **underground psytrance** (yes, I’ll headbang to Noizenecio straight out of Hokkaido 🌀).  
If it sparks emotion or pushes imagination, it has a place in my world.
