#  ‧͙⁺˚*･༓☾ Hai~!! ☽༓･*˚⁺‧͙

I’m **bloom**; a writer, creative technologist, and dreamer who blends imagination, music, and code to build meaningful things.

## About Me
* I love weaving stories and building projects that feel human, empathetic, and a little magical.  
* Music is my constant fuel: from dreamy uplifting-trance to J-CORE! ( Japanese Stream Hardcore's Compilations are soooo good! ).
* If it sparks emotion or pushes imagination, it has a place in my world.

## Fun Fact
I’m equal parts soft dreamer and an idiot! — and that duality drives everything I create.
